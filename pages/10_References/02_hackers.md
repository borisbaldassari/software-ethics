# Hacker's ethic

## Steven Levy

Steven Levy https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hacker_ethic

[Levy][levy1984] (1984) suggests that there is a "code of ethics" for hacking which, though not pasted on the walls, is in the air:

* Access to Computers - and anything which might teach you something about the way the world works - should be unlimited and total.
* Always yield to the Hands-On Imperative!
* All information should be free.
* Mistrust Authority - Promote Decentralization.
* Hackers should be judged by their hacking, not bogus criteria such as degrees, age, race, or position.
* You can create art and beauty on a computer.
* Computers can change your life for the better.
