# Current initiatives

Here is the good news: *there are a lot of good, interesting initiatives* around us, addressing the many concerns raised with software ethics (technical, economical, social, philosophical). They scale from small, local [fab labs](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fab_lab) to international associations, to informal groups communicating via mailing lists and forums.

* The RIPE ([Réseaux IP Européens](https://ripe.net)) has many actions regarding [diversity](https://labs.ripe.net/Members/shane/measuring-diversity-at-ripe-meetings) and [ethical considerations](https://www.ripe.net/about-us/press-centre/publications/presentations/2017/the-ripe-community-and-ethical-considerations-privacy-international/at_download/download) in their task.
* The [critical engineering manifesto](https://criticalengineering.org/).

### Technologia Incognita

There is a humongous list of references for ethics in tech on the [Hackers tribes](https://wiki.techinc.nl/index.php/Hackers_tribes) page in [Technologia Incognita](https://wiki.techinc.nl/index.php/Technologia_Incognita).

### Networked systems Ethics

This is a project from the university of Oxford: [Ethics in Networked Systems Research: Ethical, Legal and Policy reasoning for Internet Engineering](http://ensr.oii.ox.ac.uk/). The [wiki](http://networkedsystemsethics.net/index.php?title=Networked_Systems_Ethics) is worth a visit too.

### Collectives

* [Rise up](https://riseup.net) and their [list of radical servers](https://riseup.net/en/security/resources/radical-servers) that provide independent IT services to individuals and collectives.
* [La quadrature du net](https://www.laquadrature.net/)
