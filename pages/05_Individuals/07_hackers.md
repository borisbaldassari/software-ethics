# Hacker's ethic


### Free software principles

Richard Stallman, who founded the [Free Software Foundation](https://www.fsf.org/), defines free software through [four essential freedoms](https://www.gnu.org/philosophy/free-sw.html):

* The freedom to run the program as you wish, for any purpose (freedom 0).
* The freedom to study how the program works, and change it so it does your computing as you wish (freedom 1). Access to the source code is a precondition for this.
* The freedom to redistribute copies so you can help your neighbor (freedom 2).
* The freedom to distribute copies of your modified versions to others (freedom 3). By doing this you can give the whole community a chance to benefit from your changes. Access to the source code is a precondition for this.


### Steven Levy

[Steven Levy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hacker_ethic) suggests that there is a "code of ethics" for hacking which, though not pasted on the walls, is in the air:

* Access to Computers - and anything which might teach you something about the way the world works - should be unlimited and total.
* Always yield to the Hands-On Imperative!
* All information should be free.
* Mistrust Authority - Promote Decentralization.
* Hackers should be judged by their hacking, not bogus criteria such as degrees, age, race, or position.
* You can create art and beauty on a computer.
* Computers can change your life for the better.
