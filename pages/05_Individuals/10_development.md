# Development ethics

How do we, as committers of a project and actors of its community, make our product more ethical? There are a couple of easy steps:

* Adopting a code of conduct: there are ready-to-use codes available, like the [Contributor Covenant](https://www.contributor-covenant.org/). GitHub also proposes a [default template](https://help.github.com/articles/adding-a-code-of-conduct-to-your-project/) when creating a new project.
* Enforcing the code of conduct, and providing easy means for people to raise ethical issues.
* Setting up a transparent and publicly available governance model for the project.
* Nurishing quality- and ethical- initiatives within the projects, whatever they may be.

Other more time-consuming aspects may include software quality attributes, like reliability, maintainability or usability, community-related commitment to diversity and support, and user data protection.


### Adopt a code of conduct

There are thousands of examples on the Internet -- see the [dedicated section](/Communities/opensource.html) on this web site. The simplest option is to use a ready-to-use template like the [Contributor Covenant](https://www.contributor-covenant.org/).


### Enforce ethics in the project

Having a code of conduct is simply not enough. It needs to be enforced, and procedures are to be created to report safely harassment and unethical behaviour.

See the [word of the covenant licence team](http://contributor-covenant.org/) on this topic. It is also worth noting that it may be needed to include a mechanism for addressing grievances to **prevent abuse of the code of conduct** -- see http://citizencodeofconduct.org/ section 8.
