## Code of conduct

Ethics: treat others as you would like to be treated.


Has several aspects:

* behaving in community
* transparency
* code quality, documentation, licencing.
* usage of software


Leading characteristics:

* be nice, do good
* be responsible
* be positive
* be brave: be straight, don't cheat


For software developers:

* support your community
* don't cheat
* transparency: governance of projects, publish reports, don't hide anything

Code of ethics is for business and decision-making, code of conduct is for actions and behaviour. https://www.whistleblowersecurity.com/blog/code-of-ethics-and-code-of-conduct-whats-the-difference
