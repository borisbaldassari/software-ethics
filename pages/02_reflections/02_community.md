# Community ethics

## Core values

Main words: care, respect, foster and protect.


Treat others as you would like to be treated.

* Community
    * Diversity: whatever the colour, beliefs, political views, sexual orientation.
    * Respect: treat strangers as you would like to be treated.
    * Positivism: be positive. When you say no, also say why. Don't build against; if you don't like it, build a better system.


## Respect


## Diversity

People with different perspectives, mindsets, characteristics are needed to build a sustainable and healthy community.

The difference and mutual respect among people is the wealth of the community.
