# About this initiative

## This web site

This web site is written in markdown for its content, and uses [Contenticious](http://mirko.westermeier.de/contenticious/) for the rendering.

The source is publicly available on [GitHub](https://github.com/borisbaldassari/software-ethics). [GitHub issues](https://github.com/borisbaldassari/software-ethics/issues) can be used for any request. Forks and pull requests are welcome and will be managed diligently.

The markdown flavour and rendering engine used should be tolerant enough to allow extra formatting if needed. The template also embeds the bootstrap and font-awesome cdn headers, see [the code](https://github.com/borisbaldassari/software-ethics/blob/master/templates/layouts/contenticious.html.ep) for more details.
