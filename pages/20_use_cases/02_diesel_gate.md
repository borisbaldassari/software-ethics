Killer robots are autonomous weapons that can decide by themselves to trigger a lethal shot.

## Official positions

[This document](references/kamerbrief-over-kabinetsreactie-op-aiv-cavv-advies-autonome-wapensystemen-de-noodzaak-van-betekenisvolle-menselijke-controle__1_.pdf) states the official government's position on human-in-the-loop for autonomous weapon systems, in which it is argued that if the targeting is programmed by a human being this counts as enough “human in the wider loop” and should be acceptable. It’s an official letter from the minister of foreign affairs to the government of the Netherlands responding to the opposition's questions regarding their position on the matter.

The EU is currently working on the regulation of autonomous weapons, i.e. without a human in the loop.
