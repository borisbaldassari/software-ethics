Ready-to-use templates to help people set up easily a code of conduct for their project.

* The [Contributor Covenant](http://contributor-covenant.org/) is widely spread and adopted.
* The [Citizen Code of Conduct](http://citizencodeofconduct.org/) has a much wider scope than  software-oriented communities, but brings interesting points.
* The [Open Code of Conduct](http://todogroup.org/opencodeofconduct/ (now discontinued). At some point in time it [had some success](https://github.com/blog/2039-adopting-the-open-code-of-conduct).
* A thoughtful code of conduct from [Geek Feminism](http://geekfeminism.org/about/code-of-conduct/).

### A code of conduct for conferences

[This code of conduct](https://github.com/confcodeofconduct/confcodeofconduct.com) is targeted at a conference event. It is interesting to note the addendum on tweets, that must follow the same rules.

> Our conference is dedicated to providing a harassment-free conference experience for everyone, regardless of gender, sexual orientation, disability, physical appearance, body size, race, or religion. We do not tolerate harassment of conference participants in any form. Sexual language and imagery is not appropriate for any conference venue, including talks, workshops, parties, Twitter and other online media. Conference participants violating these rules may be sanctioned or expelled from the conference without a refund at the discretion of the conference organisers.

### Extract: VoxMedia

This [code of conduct](http://code-of-conduct.voxmedia.com/) governs the environment of the Vox Product team. Here is the Quick Version section:

> We created it not because we anticipate bad behavior, but because we believe that articulating our values and obligations to one another reinforces the already exceptional level of respect among the team and because having a code provides us with clear avenues to correct our culture should it ever stray from that course.
