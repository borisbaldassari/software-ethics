We do not tolerate harassment of conference participants in any form. Sexual language and imagery is not appropriate for any conference venue, including talks, workshops, parties, Twitter and other online media.

### Extract: VoxMedia

This [code of conduct](http://code-of-conduct.voxmedia.com/) governs the environment of the Vox Product team. Here is the Quick Version section:

> We created it not because we anticipate bad behavior, but because we believe that articulating our values and obligations to one another reinforces the already exceptional level of respect among the team and because having a code provides us with clear avenues to correct our culture should it ever stray from that course.
