# Governance

The governance of a project sets its fairness and ethical values.

### The flaws of meritocracy

Meritocracy is a beloved concept in open-source communities. But although it seems to be remarkably efficient (see the Debian project, and generally speaking all major free software organisations), **it is not necessarily ethical**. Many voices [ [1](http://geekfeminism.wikia.com/wiki/Meritocracy), [2](https://www.theatlantic.com/business/archive/2015/12/meritocracy/418074/) ], and studies have shown that organizational cultures that value meritocracy [often result in greater inequality](http://asq.sagepub.com/content/55/4/543.short). People with "merit" are also often [excused for their bad behavior](https://modelviewculture.com/pieces/the-dehumanizing-myth-of-the-meritocracy) in public spaces based on the value of their technical contributions.
