navi_name: Diesel gate


# Use cases: The diesel gate

A [big institutionalised lie](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diesel_emissions_scandal) set up to bypass state environmental regulation, and widespread across the whole automotive industry. The European authorities knew it, the states knew it, the companies knew it. But as Segolene Royal (the former french head of the ministry for the environment) said during an [official commission](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZiIoRq3e9L8), "we cannot impede our national companies".

Meanwhile, outdoor air pollution [kills 3M people per year worldwide](http://www.who.int/mediacentre/factsheets/fs313/en/).
