# Use cases: Killer robots

Killer robots, or autonomous weapons, are weapons that can decide by themselves to trigger a lethal shot.

### Official positions

[This document](/references/kamerbrief.pdf) states the official dutch government's position on human-in-the-loop for autonomous weapon systems, in which it is argued that if the targeting is programmed by a human being this counts as enough "human in the wider loop" and should be acceptable. Itâ€™s an official letter from the minister of foreign affairs to the government of the Netherlands responding to the opposition's questions regarding their position on the matter.
