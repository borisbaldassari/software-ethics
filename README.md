# Software Ethics

Discussing what ethics means in software.

## What is this?

This discussion started in November, 2016 with a [talk from Tobias Geyer](https://www.eclipsecon.org/europe2016/session/heres-why-you-should-care-about-ethics-software-development) at the Project Quality Day during the [Eclipse Conference Europe](https://www.eclipsecon.org/europe2016/). Ethics in software has many implications, from community to quality and privacy.

Killer robots poses a distinct strain on developers' shoulders, by considering the human behind the code as enough human (i.e. responsible) to trigger automatic weapons. Autonomous cars, consequences of data breaches and all recent tragedies caused by software bugs highlight even more the importance of these concerns.

Today we, as developers, have a humongous responsibility towards users, humans, and the future. This needs to be discussed and further considered.


## How to contribute?

Participation and collaboration is most welcome. The repository itself *is* the web site and [github markdown](https://guides.github.com/features/mastering-markdown/) should be used, since we're mostly dealing with text resources here.

The **github wiki** is open and writable by anyone, and any substantial change on the website should be discussed there before being accepted as a pull request.


## Welcome to GitHub Pages

You can use the [editor on GitHub](https://github.com/borisbaldassari/software-ethics/edit/master/README.md) to maintain and preview the content for your website in Markdown files.

Whenever you commit to this repository, GitHub Pages will run [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/) to rebuild the pages in your site, from the content in your Markdown files.

### Markdown

### Jekyll Themes

Your Pages site will use the layout and styles from the Jekyll theme you have selected in your [repository settings](https://github.com/borisbaldassari/software-ethics/settings). The name of this theme is saved in the Jekyll `_config.yml` configuration file.
