# Software Ethics

Discussing what ethics means in software.


## How to contribute?

Participation and collaboration is most welcome. The repository itself *is* the web site and [github markdown](https://guides.github.com/features/mastering-markdown/) should be used, since we're mostly dealing with text resources here.

The **github wiki** is open and writable by anyone, and any substantial change on the website should be discussed there before being accepted as a pull request.


## Welcome to GitHub Pages

You can use the [editor on GitHub](https://github.com/borisbaldassari/software-ethics/edit/master/README.md) to maintain and preview the content for your website in Markdown files.

Whenever you commit to this repository, GitHub Pages will run [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/) to rebuild the pages in your site, from the content in your Markdown files.

### Markdown

Markdown is a lightweight and easy-to-use syntax for styling your writing. It includes conventions for

```markdown
Syntax highlighted code block

For more details see [GitHub Flavored Markdown](https://guides.github.com/features/mastering-markdown/).

### Jekyll Themes

Your Pages site will use the layout and styles from the Jekyll theme you have selected in your [repository settings](https://github.com/borisbaldassari/software-ethics/settings). The name of this theme is saved in the Jekyll `_config.yml` configuration file.
