## Why do ethics matter in software?

### About Ethics [ 1 / 2 ]

* **Ethics** is the study of *values* and *customs* of a person or a group.
* Or: understanding the difference between right and wrong, and how to apply it.
* Examples: Consequencialism, Deontology, Virtue.

### About Ethics [ 2 / 2 ]

* **Politics** is the study of the relative distribution of power / authority / privileges in human societies.
* Technology is not neutral.
* We are always making (technological) choices.
* These choices have consequences.

Note:

Because software is ruling more and more our lives, every action we take when developing, supporting, spreading, or fixing software has a political impact. It has an impact on:
* Direct users, how they will do their daily work.
* Companies, how they will manage their processes and production lines
* Institutions
* All people

### Software is eating the world

* Software is everywhere, and it has a tremendous impact on our lives.
* Everyone uses software without even knowing it.
* This technology is a double-edged sword.

Note:

We use software every day. States have digitalised a great part of our data. Our habits, through the phones, computers, network connections and bank transactions, are known and consigned somewhere.

Software makes us fly, and sometimes crashes planes [ref needed]. Software makes us leave longer and better, and sometimes kills us when trying to do so [Therac]. Software makes us hear and see the whole world, and sometimes is used to counterfait it. And if war comes upon us, then we'll probably be killed by some software-engineered weapons.

### The consequences of software

* Software has personal, communitarian, social and environmental consequences.
* **Not everyone understands** what software is.
  **We do** understand software. We do know the limits, the risks, the consequences. **We can act.**
* With great power comes great responsibility.


Note:

We, as hackers, used to be considered outsiders, on the margins of the society, but with the increase of the importance of the Internet, we have gained considerable power.

## Personal Ethics

How do we, as individuals, manage ethics?

                      <textarea data-template>
### History and Initiatives

* Hacker's ethics (S. Levy, P. Himanem, E.S. Raymond..)
* The four essential freedoms of free software (Richard Stallman)
* Fab-Labs, conferences and workshops on ethical hacking, techno-shamanism, techno-utopians..

Note:

Free software

* The freedom to run the program as you wish, for any purpose.
* The freedom to study how the program works, and change it so it does your computing as you wish. (*)
* The freedom to redistribute copies so you can help your neighbour.
* The freedom to distribute copies of your modified versions to others. (*)

<small>(*) Access to the source code is a precondition for this.</small>

It also means that following these lines we cannot prevent military use of a piece of software we have written.


[Steven Levy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hacker_ethic) (1984) suggests that there is a "code of ethics" for hacking which, though not engraved in stone, is in the air:

* Access to Computers - and anything which might teach you something about the way the world works - should be unlimited and total.
* All information should be free.
* Mistrust Authority - Promote Decentralization.
* Hackers should be judged by their hacking, not bogus criteria such as degrees, age, race, or position.
* Computers can change your life for the better.

### Self-introspection

* Doing our own [mea culpa](https://medium.freecodecamp.org/the-code-im-still-ashamed-of-e4c021dff55e) helps.
* Define our own ethical limits. What would we do, what would we not?
* Read, think, discuss, share, build...

### Know yourself

* Between what we know we would do and what we know we would never do there is a grey zone.
* Most of the time the devil lies in this grey zone.
* As a consequence, what we need to do is reduce this zone.
* Where is our own grey zone? Do we do it right?

Note:

* Care. Be nice, do good. Discuss.

### Building ethical software

* Licensing.
* Adopting a code of conduct -- and enforcing it.
* Setting up a transparent and fair governance model.
* Nurishing quality- and ethical- initiatives.

### Ethics and code of conduct: state of practice

* **Code of ethics** is for business and decision-making.
* **Code of conduct** is for actions and behaviour.

* Most organisations now have a code of conduct and/or a code of ethics.

* Some professions have a **Code of professional practice**. (not ours though)

Note:

* Most of what we call ethics is unwritten. Instead, like many cultural rules, they're mostly implicit. But having a code of conduct is a good thing. It formalises the intent and lays down sane foundations for further discussion and action.
* Code of deontology: many disciplines have a code of professional practice, e.g. Hypocrate's oath for medecine.
* Big companies even have a variety of them for their contractors, colleagues, users, providers.
* [Code of professional practice & Professional responsibility](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ethical_code#Code_of_practice_.28professional_ethics.29)

### Ethics in Open source communities

* All major forges (e.g. Apache, Eclipse, OpenStack) have a code of conduct and enforce it.
* There is a common concern about the understanding, interpretation, and application of an ethics code and in most cases of a breach there are prompt reactions.
* Procedures exist to report and deal with cases.
* Strong emphasis on respect, diversity, fairness.. And meritocracy.

### Ethics at the Eclipse Foundation

* Transparency, Openness, Meritocracy
* **IP policy** &mdash; it's not only for lawyers, it's also about fairness.
* **Governance** &mdash; a transparent and independent structure.
* Many initiatives from members: diversity, demo camps, talks.
* You can follow the conversation on the `#diversity` channel on Mattermost.

### A word about meritocracy

Meritocracy is efficient, but it can be unethical.
* Often results in [greater inequality](http://asq.sagepub.com/content/55/4/543.short).
* Can be [excuse for bad behaviour](https://modelviewculture.com/pieces/the-dehumanizing-myth-of-the-meritocracy) based on contributions.
* See [Emilio J. Castilla](https://ecastill.scripts.mit.edu/)'s work.

### Use Cases > Whistleblowers

> *It’s difficult to get a man to understand something when his salary depends on him not understanding it.* [ [Upton Sinclair](https://medium.com/@aarijmerchant/thank-you-for-sharing-your-experience-fc67bfc447c0) ]

* Requires courage and preparation.
* A very effective weapon against corruption.
* Now some job interviews include such questions.

### Use Cases > Killer robots

* Self-triggering weapons: no human in the loop.
* Killer robots already exist (DoDaam, Samsung).
* Antipersonnel mines are forbidden by the Geneva convention.

### Use Cases > Diesel gate

* Big [institutionalised lie](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diesel_emissions_scandal). Everybody knew.
* Meanwhile, [3 million people](http://www.who.int/mediacentre/factsheets/fs313/en/) die every year from outdoor air pollution.
* Even whistleblowers were not heard (at least in France).

Note:

* The European authorities knew it, the states knew it, the company knew it. But as Segolene Royal (the former french head of the ministry for the environment) said during a commission review on the matter, "we cannot impede our national companies".
* Meanwhile, outdoor air pollution [kills 3M people per year](http://www.who.int/mediacentre/factsheets/fs313/en/) in the world.

### From oneself to the world

* Ethics start from inner thinking and extend to the world.
* We need to prepare ourselves for difficult situations.
* Rising awareness, both as individuals and as a community, is mandatory.
* One word: we **care**.

Note:

* Care. Be nice, do good. Discuss.

### What's next?

* Write a manifesto (like Hypocrate's oath)?
* Assess projects' ethical dimension (like maintainability or reliability)?
* What about a suitable ethical label (like sustainable trade does)?

Note:

* Care. Be nice. Do good. Discuss.
