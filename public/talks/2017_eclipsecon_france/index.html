## Why do ethics matter in software?

Technology is not neutral.

Note:

* We are always making a choice.
* Our actions have consequences.

### Software is omnipresent

* Software is everywhere, and it has a tremendous impact on our lifes.
* Everybody uses software, even without knowing it.
* Technology is a double-edged sword [ [Lin2008](http://ethical.software/references) ].

Note:
We use software every day. States have digitalised a great part of our data. Our habits, through the phones, computers, network connections and bank transactions, are known and consigned somewhere.

Software makes us fly, and sometimes crashes planes [ref needed]. Software makes us leave longer and better, and sometimes kills us when trying to do so [Therac]. Software makes us hear and see the whole world, and sometimes is used to counterfait it. And if war comes upon us, then we'll probably be killed by some software-engineered weapons.

### We are the experts

* Not everybody understands what software is.
* We do understand software. We do know the limits, the risks, the consequences. We can act.
* With great power comes great responsibility.


Note:
We, as hackers, used to be considered outsiders, on the margins of the society, but with the increase of the importance of the Internet, we have gained considerable power.

### Doing software **is** a political act

* **Politics** is the study of the relative distribution of power / authority / privileges in human societies.
* Technology is not neutral.
* We are always making a choice.
* Our actions have consequences.

Note:
Because software is ruling more and more our lives, every action we take when developing, supporting, spreading, or fixing software has a political impact. It has an impact on:
* Direct users, how they will do their daily work.
* Companies, how they will manage their processes and production lines
* Institutions
* All people

### Philosophy and ethics

Ethics is the study of *values* and *customs* of a person or a group.

* Or: understanding the difference 
* Or: the philosophy on how to act.

* Three main streams: Consequencialism, Deontology, Virtue
* Many disciplines have a code of professional practice, e.g. Hypocrate's oath for .

### Litterature

Isaac Asimov
* A robot may not injure a human being or, through inaction, allow a human being to come to harm.
* A robot must obey the orders given it by human beings except where such orders would conflict with the First Law.
* A robot must protect its own existence as long as such protection does not conflict with the First or Second Laws.

<small>-- From the "Handbook of Robotics, 56th Edition, 2058 A.D."</small>

### Free Software

* The freedom to run the program as you wish, for any purpose.
* The freedom to study how the program works, and change it so it does your computing as you wish. (*)
* The freedom to redistribute copies so you can help your neighbor.
* The freedom to distribute copies of your modified versions to others. (*)

<small>(*) Access to the source code is a precondition for this.</small>

It also means that following these lines we cannot prevent military use of a piece of software we write.

### Hacker's ethics

[Steven Levy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hacker_ethic) (1984) suggests that there is a "code of ethics" for hacking which, though not pasted on the walls, is in the air:

* Access to Computers - and anything which might teach you something about the way the world works - should be unlimited and total.
* All information should be free.
* Mistrust Authority - Promote Decentralization.
* Hackers should be judged by their hacking, not bogus criteria such as degrees, age, race, or position.
* Computers can change your life for the better.

### Ethics and code of conduct: state of practice

* **Code of ethics** is for business and decision-making,
* **Code of conduct** is for actions and behaviour.

* Some professions have a **Code of professional practice**.

* Most organisations now have a code of conduct and/or a code of ethics.

Note:
* Most of what we call ethics is unwritten. Instead, like many cultural rules, they're mostly implicit. But having a code of conduct is a good thing. It formalises the intent and lays down sane foundations for further discussion and action.
* Big companies even have a variety of them for their contractors, colleagues, users, providers.

### Ethics in Open source communities

All major forges (e.g. Apache, GitHub, Eclipse) have a code of conduct and enforce it. There is a common concern about understanding and application of ethics code and in most cases of breach there are prompt reactions.

### Know yourself

* Between what we know we would do and what we know we would never do is a grey zone.
* Most of the time the devil lies in this grey zone.
* As a consequence, what we need to do is reduce this zone.

Care. Be nice, do good. Discuss.
