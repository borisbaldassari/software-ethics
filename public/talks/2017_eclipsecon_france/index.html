## Why do ethics matter in software?

Technology is not neutral.

Note:

* We are always making a choice.
* Our actions have consequences.

### Software is omnipresent

* Software is everywhere, and it has a tremendous impact on our lives.
* Everyone uses software without even knowing it.
* Technology is a double-edged sword [ [Lin2008](http://ethical.software/references) ].

Note:
We use software every day. States have digitalised a great part of our data. Our habits, through the phones, computers, network connections and bank transactions, are known and consigned somewhere.

Software makes us fly, and sometimes crashes planes [ref needed]. Software makes us leave longer and better, and sometimes kills us when trying to do so [Therac]. Software makes us hear and see the whole world, and sometimes is used to counterfait it. And if war comes upon us, then we'll probably be killed by some software-engineered weapons.

### We are the experts

* Not everyone understands what software is.
* We do understand software. We do know the limits, the risks, the consequences. We can act.
* With great power comes great responsibility.


Note:
We, as hackers, used to be considered outsiders, on the margins of the society, but with the increase of the importance of the Internet, we have gained considerable power.

### Doing software **is** a political act

* **Politics** is the study of the relative distribution of power / authority / privileges in human societies.
* Technology is not neutral.
* We are always making a choice.
* Our actions have consequences.

Note:
Because software is ruling more and more our lives, every action we take when developing, supporting, spreading, or fixing software has a political impact. It has an impact on:
* Direct users, how they will do their daily work.
* Companies, how they will manage their processes and production lines
* Institutions
* All people

### Philosophy and ethics

Definitions

* Ethics is the study of *values* and *customs* of a person or a group.
* Or: understanding the difference between right and wrong, and how to apply it.
* Or: the philosophy on how to act.

Three main streams:
Consequencialism, Deontology, Virtue


Note:
* Many disciplines have a code of professional practice, e.g. Hypocrate's oath for .

### Litterature

Isaac Asimov
* A robot may not injure a human being or, through inaction, allow a human being to come to harm.
* A robot must obey the orders given it by human beings except where such orders would conflict with the First Law.
* A robot must protect its own existence as long as such protection does not conflict with the First or Second Laws.

### Free Software

* The freedom to run the program as you wish, for any purpose.
* The freedom to study how the program works, and change it so it does your computing as you wish. (*)
* The freedom to redistribute copies so you can help your neighbour.
* The freedom to distribute copies of your modified versions to others. (*)

<small>(*) Access to the source code is a precondition for this.</small>

It also means that following these lines we cannot prevent military use of a piece of software we have written.

### Hackers' ethics

[Steven Levy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hacker_ethic) (1984) suggests that there is a "code of ethics" for hacking which, though not pasted on the walls, is in the air:

* Access to Computers - and anything which might teach you something about the way the world works - should be unlimited and total.
* All information should be free.
* Mistrust Authority - Promote Decentralization.
* Hackers should be judged by their hacking, not bogus criteria such as degrees, age, race, or position.
* Computers can change your life for the better.

### Ethics and code of conduct: state of practice

* **Code of ethics** is for business and decision-making.
* **Code of conduct** is for actions and behaviour.

* Some professions have a **Code of professional practice**.

* Most organisations now have a code of conduct and/or a code of ethics.

Note:
* Most of what we call ethics is unwritten. Instead, like many cultural rules, they're mostly implicit. But having a code of conduct is a good thing. It formalises the intent and lays down sane foundations for further discussion and action.
* Big companies even have a variety of them for their contractors, colleagues, users, providers.
* [Code of professional practice & Professional responsibility](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ethical_code#Code_of_practice_.28professional_ethics.29)

### Ethics in Open source communities

* All major forges (e.g. Apache, Eclipse, OpenStack) have a code of conduct and enforce it.
* There is a common concern about the understanding and application of ethics code and in most cases of breach there are prompt reactions.
* Procedures exist to escalate cases.
* Strong emphasis on respect, diversity, fairness.

### Ethics at Eclipse

* Transparency, Openness, Meritocracy
* **IP policy** &mdash; it's not only for lawers, it's also for fairness.
* **Governance** &mdash; a transparent structure, with a specific concern on its independence.
* Strong emphasis on IP strictness and diversity.

### Use Cases > Whistleblowers

* It’s difficult to get a man to understand something when his salary depends on him not understanding it. [ [Upton Sinclair](https://medium.com/@aarijmerchant/thank-you-for-sharing-your-experience-fc67bfc447c0) ]
* Loyalty is important. But conscience is even more crucial. Requires some courage and preparation.
* Now some job interviews include such questions.
* Transparency against corruption.

### Use Cases > Killer robots

* Self-triggering weapons: no human in the loop.
* Killer robots already exist (DoDaam, Samsung).
* Antipersonnel mines are forbidden by the Geneva convention.
* Kill switches? International ban?

### Use Cases > Diesel gate

* Big [institutionalised lie](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diesel_emissions_scandal). Everybody knew.
* Meanwhile, [3 million people](http://www.who.int/mediacentre/factsheets/fs313/en/) die every year of outdoor air pollution.
* Even whistleblowers were not heard (at least in France).

Note:
* A [big institutionalised lie](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diesel_emissions_scandal). The European authorities knew it, the states knew it, the company knew it. But as Segolene Royal (the former french head of the ministry for the environment) said during a commission review on the matter, "we cannot impede our national companies".
* Meanwhile, outdoor air pollution [kills 3M people per year](http://www.who.int/mediacentre/factsheets/fs313/en/) in the world.

### Know yourself

* Between what we know we would do and what we know we would never do there is a grey zone.
* Most of the time the devil lies in this grey zone.
* As a consequence, what we need to do is reduce this zone.

Note:
* Care. Be nice, do good. Discuss.

### What's next?

* Where is our grey zone? Do we do it right? Do we enforce it?
* Are there examples of breaches or questionable behaviour?
* If we were to write a manifesto, what would it be?

Note:
* Care. Be nice. Do good. Discuss.
